By using this FTP service, you agree to the following:

1. You will not give out the username and password given to you. 
Doing so will result in account deactivation and loss of access to all media.

2. Do not hack, crack, corrupt or otherwise try to gain unauthorized access to other parts of the FTP service. 
Not everyone will have the same access to files, folders, or directories. This is for my safety and peace of mind.

3. If you wish to request something you may do so, however I hold the right to reject, approve, decline, and accept requests at my discretion. 
PLEASE MAKE REQUESTS IN THE DISCORD SERVER UNDER THE CATEGORY AND REQUESTS SECTION OF SAID CATEGORY.

4. I have limited space, time and energy. Bigger games, movies, videos, etc. 
will be cycled out periodically to keep things interesting and have variety. 
You are free to keep your own copy of old files, but understand that my limited storage space means I may not always have what you like. 
So keep backups of your own as well.

With that out of the way, enjoy your stay!
